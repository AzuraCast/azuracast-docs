Our core maintainers, along with our vast community of station operators, can answer many questions you may have about our software. We also have knowledge base articles set up for common issues encountered by our users.

# First Steps

Your first steps should be to check these docs for any tips or pointers. Many common issues can be solved by following the instructions in our guide pages.

If you aren't sure of what is causing your issue, [checking the logs](/en/user-guide/logs) can help. Not only do the system logs often explain your error in more detail, but they're essential for our developers to be able to easily diagnose and resolve your issue.

# Submitting an Issue

If you encounter an issue that you can not resolve with the documentation please refer to our guide on [how to report a bug](/en/contribute/report-a-bug).
