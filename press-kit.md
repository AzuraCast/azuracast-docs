# Press Kit 
AzuraCast welcomes any and all respective media agencies and freelance journalists to utilize our branding in a upcoming publication and/or article. This page will provide our images, audio and files that you may wish to include. 

## About Us
The history about AzuraCast is a long and storied one, starting back in early 2015 with our first entrance into the first version of our project, which would later turn into AzuraCast. The project was ran by Buster "Silver Eagle" Neece, who remains as lead developer of AzuraCast. 

We have a small team of three people, two developers and one community moderator. 

We have done a public talk with our partners at Liquidsoap where we discuss AzuraCast, the problems we face in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) ecosystem and our beginging roots.
