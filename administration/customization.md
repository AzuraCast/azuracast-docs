# Customizing the CSS

AzuraCast provides you with the possibility to customize the default CSS via the `Custom Branding` page at `/admin/branding`.

There you can alter the styling of the internal and public pages via your own CSS with the editors for `Custom CSS for Public Pages` and `Custom CSS for Internal Pages`.

[This page](/en/administration/customization/css) will give you a simple overview of the CSS classes and ids used in the HTML of AzuraCast that you can then use in your own CSS to customize those elements.

If you have no prior experience with CSS take a look at the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) about CSS.
