For each station there are `Storage Locations` defined in AzuraCast for `Station Media`, `Station Recordings` and `Backups`.

A `Storage Location` can be one of the following types:

- Local Filesystem
- S3 Compatible
- Dropbox

# S3 Storage Location

If you want to use an S3 compatible storage provider to store your files please refer to our [S3 Configuration guide](/en/user-guide/storage-locations/s3-configuration).

# Dropbox Storage Location
