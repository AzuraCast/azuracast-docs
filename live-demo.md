Want to see AzuraCast for yourself?

We have a demo site with a small AzuraCast installation and a single radio station, where you can see the basics of the AzuraCast web interface in action.

Visit our demo site at demo.azuracast.com:

**Username:** `demo@azuracast.com`
**Password:** `demo`

> The AzuraCast demo instance automatically resets at the top of every hour to a fresh copy. If you try to access the demo site at exactly the top of the hour, you may be automatically redirected back to our website; just try again in a minute or two.
